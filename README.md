# Practice exercises from ["The Well-Grounded Rubyist"](https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-rubyist-third-edition) book

Excellent book, highly recommended!

It’s hard to really understand Ruby, its philosophy and idioms, without help from a book like this. Before reading the book, I thought many Ruby constructs were "magic" syntax figured-out by the engine… when in fact they were basic language constructs, reused with creativity for the sake of brevity and expressiveness.

My confidence in reading, understanding, and writing Ruby has improved tremendously from reading this book, and following the practice exercises.

Even if you’re advanced, I’m sure you can still benefit, and gain new insight from reading this book.

**Enjoy!**
